# Ticketing-Project
this respository is the implementation of a class project.
in this project we were suppose to create a simple tornado server that would handle user tickets and admin replys.
additionally we had to write a simple client app that would connect to the server and provide a simple API to interact with the server capabilities.
for a tutorial on how to use the client command line app you can download this video:
